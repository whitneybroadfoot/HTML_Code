This will be a fluid document to practice different HTML basics:
- [x] Stay up to date on any changes or updates to HTML5 formatting
- [x] Refer back to this page so that I do not become so reliant on starter code with HTML provided
- [x] Ingrain the basics, and use them as the building blocks of a coding future

All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html> and all web developers must start somewhere!
