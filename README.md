This will be a fluid document to practice different HTML basics:
- [x] Stay up to date on any changes or updates to HTML5 formatting
- [x] Refer back to this repo so that I do not become reliant on starter code with HTML provided
- [x] Ingrain the basics, and use them as the building blocks of a coding future

All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: < !DOCTYPE html > and all web developers must start somewhere!

HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages | HTML describes the structure of a Web page | HTML consists of a series of elements | HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content | HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.
